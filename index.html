					<p>Crystals are a beautiful and gentle meditation tool that can be used to help restore peace to one's mind, spirit and body. The earth spends many years growing crystals inside of it, and crystals can continue to grow and change even when removed from Earth's nourishing body. Each crystal resonates with a unique energy. Find a crystal that speaks to your heart, and use it to connect more deeply with yourself, your goals and wishes, and the beautiful beings around you.</p>
					<p>Each Crystal has been hand picked for its uniqueness, brilliance, and beauty. 
					To charge the energy of your Crystal, simply place it in the moonlight.</p>

					<p>Hi boys. I'm Tina. I'm a smart, strong, sensual woman. Hey Jimmy Jr. Did you see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard? Everyone touched each other's butts, and it was great. Butts. Everything I know to be true just went out the window. I need to find a boy with a turtle bite on his finger. Do you think horses get songs stuck in their heads? This is where I thrash. Explore the morgue? Follow me fellas...Lets go somewhere where the sixteen of us can be alone. I need to find a boy with a turtle bite on his finger.

					<p>This is where I thrash. It includes material that may not be suitable for all ages. I could go to jail, or hell, or jail-hell. Chad the Zombie touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi. My hearttttttttt. Chad the Zombie touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi. Please don't tell Mom and Dad. I'm not spooked. What's the next thing after spooked? I'm that. If I were a hamburger you'd come and watch! Ugg, my heart just pooped its pants. Put it on a t-shirt, Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it. Give them ridiculous French accents. I guess she doesn't like wearing clothes. I texted back a smiley face. She texted back some letters I don't understand.</p>
